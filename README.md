# Linear Regression: Linear regression is a statistical method for determining the relationship between two or more variables. It involves using an independent or known variable to predict the dependent or response variable. Linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between a scalar response (or dependent variable) and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables). The process of finding a straight line that best approximates a set of points on a graph is also called linear regression.
